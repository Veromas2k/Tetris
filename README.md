Rotation:
Super Rotation System, or SRS is the current Tetris Guideline standard for how tetrominoes behave, in a broad sense. SRS represents where and how tetrominoes spawn, how they rotate, and what wall kicks they may perform. In TI, a player may choose between World and Classic rotation styles. World closely resembles SRS, and Classic closely resembles the rotation styles of its predecessors TGM and TAP. Henk Rogers, in his effort to unify all new Tetris games into the Tetris Guideline, required Arika to include SRS, which is called World in Ti. SRS traces its routes back to 1991 when BPS introduced its signature third and fourth orientations for the S, Z, and I tetrominoes in their Tetris 2+Bombliss. Later would come flipped-side-up spawned T, L, and J tetrominoes and flexible new wall kicks. Probably the most accurate SRS finds itself in BPS's latest games Tetris Worlds and Tetris Deluxe, which both feature exact same rotation styles.
